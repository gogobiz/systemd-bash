$BUILTIN logger
$FUNCTION logger_builtin
$DEPENDS_ON V9_ECHO
$SHORT_DOC logger [-neE] [arg ...]
Write arguments to the standard output.

Display the ARGs on the standard output followed by a newline.

Options:
  -n	do not append a newline
  -e	enable interpretation of the following backslash escapes
  -E	explicitly suppress interpretation of backslash escapes

`logger' interprets the following backslash-escaped characters:
  \a	alert (bell)
  \b	backspace
  \c	suppress further output
  \e	escape character
  \f	form feed
  \n	new line
  \r	carriage return
  \t	horizontal tab
  \v	vertical tab
  \\	backslash
  \0nnn	the character whose ASCII code is NNN (octal).  NNN can be
	0 to 3 octal digits
  \xHH	the eight-bit character whose value is HH (hexadecimal).  HH
	can be one or two hex digits

Exit Status:
Returns success unless a write error occurs.
